Chatbot
This is a Python implementation of a Simple ChatBot using the DialoGPT-medium model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The ChatBot generates responses to user input based on the model's training on a large corpus of conversational data.I built a real-time face mask detection model, predicted Boston house prices using regression, and classified American Sign Language hand signs with deep learning.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher TensorFlow 2.0 or higher Hugging Face Transformers library
